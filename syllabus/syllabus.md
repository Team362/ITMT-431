## Course Catalog Description

In this capstone course, students will identify, gather, analyze, and write requirements based on user needs and will then design, construct, integrate, and implement an information system as a solution to a business problem.  Students will document integration architecture, methodologies, and technologies using industry best practices.  User needs and user centered design will be applied in the selection, creation, evaluation, and administration of the resulting system.  The system design process will take into account professional, ethical, legal, security, and social issues and responsibilities and stress the local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society.  Discussion will also cover the need to engage in continuing professional development. [ITMT 430 Bulletin Description](http://bulletin.iit.edu/courses/itmt/ "ITMT 430 Bulletin Description")
